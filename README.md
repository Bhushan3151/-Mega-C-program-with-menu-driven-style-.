# Mega C Programming Demo üöÄ
 
This repository contains a **mega C program** (`All_In_One.c`) that demonstrates 
concepts from **beginner to advanced level** in a **menu-driven style**.
 
It is designed as an educational project to help learners explore:
- Basics (number system, factorial, prime, Fibonacci, GCD/LCM)
- Searching & Sorting Algorithms (linear/binary search, bubble/selection/insertion/merge/quick/heap/radix/shell/counting/bucket/cocktail sort)
- IPC Mechanisms (pipe, message queue, shared memory with semaphore)
- Device Driver Simulation (ring buffer, writer/reader threads, optional SIGUSR1 interrupt, blocking read)
- Bitwise Operations (set, clear, toggle, check, count bits)
- Data Structures (queue, singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list, heap, tree, graph)
- Signal Handling (Ctrl+C global interrupt with timestamp)
- Polling Demo (detecting key press like `q` to quit)

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
 
- **Menu-driven navigation** ‚Äì choose what you want to run.
- **Beginner friendly** ‚Äì small examples of prime, Fibonacci, factorial.
- **Advanced** ‚Äì IPC, ring buffer, threading, synchronization.
- **Professional logs** for simulation (especially device-driver section).
- **Single-file demo** (easy to compile & run).
